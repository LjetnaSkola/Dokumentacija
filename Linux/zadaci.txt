1. Write a Bash script which accepts (name) as input and displays the greeting "Welcome (name)"

	echo "Enter name (name) :" 
	read name

	echo "Greeting message :"
	echo "Welcome $name"

2. Your task is to use for loops to display only odd natural numbers from A to B.

	echo "Enter variable A (A) :"
	read A
	echo "Enter variable B (B) :"
	read B
	
    echo "Odd numbers from $A to $B are:"
    for (( i=A; i<=B; i++ ))
    do
      if (( i % 2 != 0 ))
      then
        echo $i
      fi
    done	


3. Write a shell script that accepts a number greater than 3, let's say N. The script prints the Fibonacci sequence with N numbers in the sequence.

    echo "Enter a number greater than 3 (N) :"
    read N
    
    if [N -lt 4]; then
        echo "Number must be greater than 3!"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    function fibonacci {
    
        local num=$1
        a=0
        b=1
    
        echo "Fibonacci array of $num numbers:"
        
        for (( i=0; i<num; i++ ))
        do
            echo -n "$a "
            fn=$((a + b))
            a=$b
            b=$fn
        done
        echo
    }

    fibonacci $N

4. Write a shell script that accepts a non-negative number and shows its factorial as output.

5. Given M lines of input, print the Nth character from each line as a new line of output. It is guaranteed that each of the M lines of input will have a Nth character.
Input:
Hello
World
how are you

Output: In case N=3
l
r
w

6. Display the first 5 lines of an input file.
7. Print file in reverse order
8. Display the last 4 characters of an input file.
9. Given a list of countries, each on a new line, your task is to read them into an array. Then, concatenate the array with itself (twice) - so that you have a total of three repetitions of the original array - and then display the entire concatenated array, with a space between each of the countries' names.
Input:
Namibia
Nauru
Nepal
Netherlands
NewZealand
Nicaragua
Niger
Nigeria
NorthKorea
Norway
OUTPUT:
Namibia Nauru Nepal Netherlands NewZealand Nicaragua Niger Nigeria NorthKorea Norway Namibia Nauru Nepal Netherlands NewZealand Nicaragua Niger Nigeria NorthKorea Norway Namibia Nauru Nepal Netherlands NewZealand Nicaragua Niger Nigeria NorthKorea Norway

10. Given a text file, which will be piped to your command through STDIN, use grep to display all those lines which contain any of the following words in them:
the
that
then
those
The search should not be sensitive to case. Display only those lines of an input file, which contain the required words
